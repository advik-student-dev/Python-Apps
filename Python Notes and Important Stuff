Notes

1. Data Types
    Numeric:-
        (a) Integers
        (b) Floats
        (c) Complex
    Sequence:-
        (a) List
        (b) Tuple
        (c) Range
    Mapping:-
        Dict
    Text Type:-
        String

2. Loops
      (a) For-loops
      (b) While loops

3. Operators
     Logical:-
         (a) And
         (b) Or
         (c) Not
     Arithmetic:-
         (a) + (Addition)
         (b) - (Subtraction)
         (c) * (Multiplication)
         (d) / (Division)
         (e) % (Modulus - Gets the remainder)
         (f) ** (Exponentiation)
         (g) // (Floor division - Rounds down the Float num
                 to an Integer num)
     Assignment:-
         (a) =
         (b) +=
         (c) -=
         (d) *=
         (e) /=
         (f) %=
         (g) //=
         (h) **=
         (i) &=
         (j) |=
         (k) ^=
         (l) >>=
         (m) <<=
     Comparison:-
         (a) ==
         (b) !=
         (c) <
         (d) >
         (e) <=
         (f) >=
     Identity:-
         (a) is [Returns True if both variables
          are the same object]
         (b) is not [Returns True if both
         variables are not the same object]
     Membership:-
         (a) in [Returns True if a sequence
         with the specified value is present
         in the object]
         (b) not in [not in	Returns True
         if a sequence with the specified
         value is not present in the object]
4. Hard to remember (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc)
    (a) Packaging in Python
    (b) Modules
